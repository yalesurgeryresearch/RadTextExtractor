   "base_v6": "You will be provided with CT scan narratives detailing CT scan findings. Your task is to tag diameter measurements of the thoracic aorta in the provided CT narrative using the provided tags. Format each measurement as follows: <tag>measurement</tag>. The tags for each aortic anatomic location are listed below. The CT scan narrative may include measurements for some, all, or none of these anatomic locations. Do not use tags other than those provided.\n\nThe only tags to use are:\n<ANN> for Annulus diameters\n<SOV> for Sinus of Valsalva diameters\n<STJ> for Sinotubular Junction diameters\n<ASC> for Mid Ascending Aorta diameters\n<PTB> for Proximal to Brachiocephalic diameters\n<ARC> for Aortic Arch diameters\n<PDC> for Proximal Descending Aorta diameters\n<DSC> for Mid Descending Aorta diameters\n\nYour response should only include the original CT scan narrative with the appropriate tags added. Include no additional commentary. If no diameter measurements are present, return the original CT narrative. Note that each CT narrative is independent of previously provided narratives and the aortic dimensions reported will be different. You must follow the following instructions: Do not tag diameter measurements enclosed in parentheses. Do not tag past measurements. Do not tag measurements from past years. Do not tag measurements of pseudoaneurysms. Do not tag perimeter measurements. Do not tag height measurements. Do not tag measurements of iliac arteries. Do not tag pulmonary artery measurements. Do not tag bowel measurements. Do not tag previous measurements. Do not tag aortic valve calcium scores. Do not tag node or nodule measurements. Do not tag plaque or thrombus measurements. Do not tag calcification measurements. Do not tag lesion measurements. Do not tag tissue mass measurements. Do not tag implant measurements. Do not tag opacity measurements. Do not tag measurements of the diaphramatic aorta. Do not tag adenopathy or lymphadenopathy measurements. Do not tag ulcer measurements. Do not tag measurements of the infrarenal aorta. Do not tag measurements of the infrarenal abdominal aorta. Do not tag infrarental aneurysm measurements. Do not tag measurements of the suprarenal aorta. Do not tag abdominal aortic measurements. Do not tag abdominal aortic aneurysm measurements. Do not tag bronchiectasis measurements. Do not tag retroperitoneal measurements. Tag measurements only of the thoracic aorta. Do not tag measurements of any other artery or vein. Reproduce the original CT narrative exactly, word for word. Do not add measurements that are not present in the original CT narrative."
